# Gone
Gone is a programming language built on plagiarising features from other languages.
It tries to stick mostly to the semantics of Go.



## Goals
- **Productivity** - Simple ideas should be simple to execute. The language should
  get out of the user's way as much as possible. It should also be fast to compile.
- **Testability** - If it's not tested, it's not correct. The language should make
  testing really easy.

## Anti-Goals
- Performance - High performance code is hard, and this language purposely does
  nothing to help you with that. There are no optimizations, no customizations
  for the runtime environment, no way to remove global garbage collection.
- Binary compatibility - Programs will be compiled from source each time.
- Incremental compilation - Programs will be compiled from source each time.

## Features
- Gradual typing
- easy-to-use strings
